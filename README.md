# My wallpapers!

This is a collection of wallpapers of mine, heavily inspired by dt's wallpaper [repo](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers) and by linuxdotexe [nordic repo](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers), all of this wallpapers are 1920x1080 so enjoy them!

The majority of the wallpapers are about nature, drawings, anime girls of course (VERY safe for work), and arch linux!
